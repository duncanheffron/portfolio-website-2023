With a background in Interaction Design and Web Design, I'm passionate about creating the best user experiences for website viewers.</p><p>Beyond coding, I have a deep love for space, food, and movies/series, particularly anything related to the sci-fi genre. Exploring the wonders of the universe has always fascinated me, and I aspire to travel the world and work in different countries in the future.</p><p>What sets me apart is my ability to deconstruct and solve problems, always keeping the end user in mind. I believe in building the web of tomorrow, making it accessible for everybody. It's a journey that not only fulfills my professional aspirations but also allows me to connect with new and interesting people along the way.</p><p>Growing up, my people skills were initially limited, but a turning point came when I forced myself to work as a cashier at the age of 16. This experience propelled me out of my comfort zone and taught me the value of meaningful interactions.</p><p>In addition to my web development work, you can also find me behind the bar on Saturday nights, further honing my people skills and engaging with diverse individuals. This bartending experience provides valuable insights and perspectives that enhance my ability to connect with others.</p><p>If you're interested in my work, I invite you to explore my website and discover the range of skills I bring to the table. From frontend development to problem-solving, I am dedicated to creating engaging digital experiences.
