    "intro": "In October 2019, my grandmother gifted me a 25-day vacation to Gran Canaria as a celebration of my graduation. It was an incredible time filled with bus trips, solo hikes, and unforgettable encounters with English companions. The hotel's lively animation team kept us entertained, and the Indian restaurant's cuisine was a delightful treat. One of the most memorable aspects was walking alongside my grandmother's wheelchair, sharing special moments as we covered thousands of steps each day. Gran Canaria will always hold a special place in my heart.",
